LET'S DIRECTLY JUMP TO THE STEPS INVOLVED:

 1. First of all, create an IAM user by going to AWS GUI, and don't forget to download your Credentials, and store it somewhere safe, because if it gets lost(I mean accidentally deleted), then there is no way of recovering it whatsoever, and you need to make new IAM user, in my case I gave my IAM user Administrator Access.
